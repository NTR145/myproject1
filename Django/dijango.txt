In Django, makemigrations and migrate are two essential commands used to manage changes to your database schema through Django's orm

makemigrations
-Purpose:Detects changes in your models.py and creates migration files 
-what it does: Generates python files that describe how to update the database schema.
   
                       python manage.py makemigrations migrates



workflow
1.Edit your models  - add or change fields/classes.
2.run makemigrates - Django creates migration files.
3.run migrate - changes are applied to the database.

ORM in Django?
ORM stands for object-relational mapping

ORM is a programming techinque that allows you to interact with your database(such as SQlite, PostgreSQL, MYSQL, etc.) 


Django ahs a powerful and built-in ORM syatem, so you can define your database structure as python classes (models), and Django handles creating/altering/deleting the corresponding tables and rows behind the scenes.

py mange.py shell
from myapp.models import Student

#Create a new student
Student.object.create(name="",roll="")

#View all students
<class_name>.object.create(name="",roll="")
